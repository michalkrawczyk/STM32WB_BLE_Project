[Abandoned] Watering System with using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for 
STM32WB55RG .

Note: STM32WB55RG is not recommended for such projects, due to quite 
high price (propably Arduino would be better for that project).
Such Solution was choosen only for educational purpouses - 
to develop skills in programming STM32 microcontrollers and get familiar 
with newer solutions (STM32WB was released quite recently with 
introducing built-in BLE module)

Project has been Abandoned due to mistake in design from biological side - roots tends to rot when humidity is at stable not 0% level
